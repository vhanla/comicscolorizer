# Comics Colorizer

![snap01](https://github.com/vhanla/comicscolorizer/blob/main/.github/snap01.jpg?raw=true) 

This is a GUI for [Manga Colorization v2](https://github.com/qweasdd/manga-colorization-v2) that adds extra lineart extraction and blending to the final colorization resultant image, so old comics, like the sepia ones, which are different than mangas on its line drawing and shading, will have a better lineart result for the final result.

Just download into this project directory the suggested weights.

## Usage

`python Project1.py`

## Disclaimer

Not yet ready, this is a barebones starting point which I will be adding more features.
